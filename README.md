#WIXWriter

[![Support us][gittip-image]][gittip-url]

I was sick of maintaining the WIX files for my votive projects in my .net solutions.

So, hating stuff that is not automated, I automated it by writing this tool.

It recurses the solution tree and creates three files based on this blog post:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/471424/wix-tricks-and-tips  (Why it is closed I have no idea...but I digress)

Feel free to fork, and send me pull requests.

It gets the job done.  Would love to see it optimised.
